# VRGame

A tactical VR shooter game built on UE4. Your objective is to get to the end of the level, operating your weapons manually and killing everyone in your path.

There are 2 levels right now, a Shooting Range for testing the weapons and a very small tutorial level. I've only tested this with a HTC Vive, but all motion controller should work.

See the releases page for the compiled package.

Have fun!
